## The GUI, nicknamed "Grocer-E", serves as a form of an online marketplace for foods. The user can create an account for the application, log in to the application, and create a list of groceries or foods needed. To address the COVID-19 pandemic topic, the application allows for other users to access grocery lists of other people and deliver foods personally, thus avoiding the need for social proximity during shopping excursions.
